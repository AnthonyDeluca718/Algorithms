24 - Adding a single directed edge to a directed graph can reduce the number of weakly connected components, but by at most how many components? What about the number of strongly connected components?

Weakly Connected: 1. the edge can connect at most two components.

Strongly Connected: Arbitrarily many.

For i=1:n-1 there is a edge from node i to node i+1

In addition there is an edge from node 0 to every other node. this gives n+1 components.

However if we add edge (n, 0) then the entire graph is strongly connected. To get from i to j just travel: i->i+1->...->n->0->j.
