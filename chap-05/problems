24) Adding a single directed edge to a directed graph can reduce the number of weakly connected components, but by at most how many components? What about the number of strongly connected components?

Weakly Connected: 1. the edge can connect at most two components.

Strongly Connected: Arbitrarily many.

For i=1:n-1 there is a edge from node i to node i+1

In addition there is an edge from node 0 to every other node. this gives n+1 components.

However if we add edge (n, 0) then the entire graph is strongly connected. To get from i to j just travel: i->i+1->...->n->0->j.

30) Suppose G is a connected undirected graph. An edge whose removal disconnects the graph is called a bridge. Must every bridge e be an edge in a depth-first search tree of G? Give a proof or a counterexample.

Answer: Yes. The only way to get from component A to component B is to cross the edge. If we could add vertexes from both without crossing this edge we would have an alternate path.
